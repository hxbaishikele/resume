Abstract
====

Classification  and  coding  system（CCS）is  a  basic  part  for  the  lifecycle  management  of  hydroelectric  projects. Considering the current applications and demand for information development in hydroelectric projects，an extended framework for information classification is proposed based on the analysis of the CCS for lifecycle management. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in real cases. The research is helpful to establish lifecycle information standards in hydroelectric projects and can be regarded as a solid foundation for developing lifecycle information classification and coding system in other construction projects.
