Abstract
====

According to the actual demand of management during construction, this paper researches on the schedule-resource trade-off based on 4D-BIM and construction process simulation. By transforming a construction schedule into a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model, this method presented can automatically construct the schedule-resource trade-off model. Also, the paper explores and analyses the process of SA algorithm in order to tackle the schedule-resource trade-off. The whole solution is applied to solve a real problem and good results are obtained. The achievement indicates that the automatic construction of schedule-resource trade-off model can free people from intensive work. Excellent results can be obtained in a short time by SA algorithm. The solution presented in this paper constructs schedule-resource equilibrium model, simulates and optimizes construction process and reduces repetitive work, which provides managers with a practical tool to arrange the schedule and allocate resources.
